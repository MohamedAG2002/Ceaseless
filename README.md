# Ceaseless

A simple 2D endless runner made in Raylib with C++. I made a similiar game in Unity a while back but decided to remake it from scratch(kind of) with the simple game framework Raylib. For that reason the file is called "Ceaseless MKIII" as it is the third iteration, obviously. This game implements serialization, using the "fstream" library of C++. It also has some sound effects made by me in "BFXR", and background music that I got from somewhere I can't remember long ago. 

## Controls
Controling the game is simple enough: 
The SPACE BAR is to jump.
While in game, press the P key to pause, and to resume click the "RESUME" button.

## Use
If you want to get the source code(although I don't know why you might want to do that), clone the repo and open the soultion file usin Visual Studio.
On the other hand, if you want to just play the game, then go to my itch.io page to download it from there.
